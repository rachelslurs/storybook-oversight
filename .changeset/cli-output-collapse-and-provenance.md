Say what was linted, and collapse mass extraction failures. The stylish output now opens with the manifest path and its recorded extractor, and the tally counts affected manifest entries; JSON output gains `summary.manifest` (`path`, `docgen`, `entries`). When a rule's `docgen-missing` or `story-extraction-error` findings touch at least 10 distinct entries and at least half the manifest's entries, the text output and the Actions step summary render one row per error signature (signatures on fewer than 10 entries pool into one leftovers row) instead of the per-entry lines, while `--format json` keeps every finding. Extraction-failure messages now lead with the manifest error's `name` and append the message's first line when it adds information; the full error text stays on the finding's `error` field, and the name rides along on `errorName`. The addon panel's Extraction and Stories sections use the same name-led summary, hence the patch.
