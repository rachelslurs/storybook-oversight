# oversight-lint

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 82615a3: `extractor-drift` now runs only when an expectation is stated via `--expected-extractor`, the config file, or the addon config; null, empty, and whitespace values read as no expectation. The rule previously compared against a built-in `react-docgen-typescript` default, which warned on projects that never configured an extractor. The manifest side no longer defaults either: a non-empty `meta.docgen` is used verbatim, otherwise the extractor is inferred from the payload key every extracted entry shares (flag-built 10.2 manifests carry `meta: null` while still recording the extractor per entry), and when neither says anything the rule reports that the manifest does not record which extractor ran. The CLI rejects an empty `--expected-extractor` and an `extractor-drift` severity override with no expectation, instead of silently disabling the rule. The mismatch message now reads `...expects "X"; prop docs may be incomplete.` The unread `NormalizedComponent.extractor` field is removed from `oversight-core`.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 37817cc: Clamp the manifest error embedded in `docgen-missing` and `story-extraction-error` finding messages to its first non-empty line so a multi-line error (a stack trace, an embedded source file) no longer leaks into the panel or the CLI through the finding text. The full error moves to a new `error` field on those diagnostics, included in `--format json` output.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 38aa5bb: Add `--format <text|json|github>`. The new `github` format emits GitHub Actions workflow-command annotations (`::error`/`::warning`/`::notice`, titled `oversight/<rule>` and anchored to the stories file) so findings surface as annotations on the run and the pull request's Checks tab. `--json` now aliases `--format json`; findings have no line numbers, so each annotation anchors to the top of the stories file, capped at GitHub's ~10-per-type-per-step limit.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- dc6adc2: Initial release. Lints a Storybook MCP components manifest in CI over the same rules as `storybook-addon-oversight`: reads the built `components.json`, reports findings grouped by component, and exits 0 (clean), 1 (findings or over `--max-warnings`), or 2 (could not run). Supports `--json`, `--rule` overrides, `oversight.config.json`, and a GitHub Actions job-summary table.
